This project enables you to plug an Arduino Micro into a custom PCB to create a wired controller.

This repo will include code enabling you to flash your Arduino Micro with the relevant code to make this work.

This repo will also contain KiCad files such as the schematic diagram and PCB layout files to enable you to print your own PCB, as well as create modifications
